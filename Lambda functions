#Lambda functions give you a concise way to write small, throwaway functions in your code.
#we build an expense tracker
#In this project, you'll explore the power of Lambda Functions by creating an expense tracker. Your resulting app will demonstrate how you can use Lambda Functions for efficient, streamlined operations.
