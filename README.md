# python_freeCode_camp_
 This repository showcases my proficiency in Python through a collection of final-challenge projects from freeCodeCamp. Spanning scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning fundamentals, and automation, each folder represents hands-on work from over 300 hours of coursework and real-world problem solving.

What You’ll Find
- Scientific Computing files leveraging NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas etc
- Data Analysis files built with Pandas, Matplotlib, and real datasets.
 
These demonstrate that a good foundational knowledge has been obtained using python

good luck!
let's go!!
