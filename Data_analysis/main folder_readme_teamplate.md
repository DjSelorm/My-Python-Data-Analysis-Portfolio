# üìÇ Data Analysis with Python ‚Äì Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Analysis with Python** portfolio.  
This repository showcases a collection of projects completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), along with extended analyses and visualizations I‚Äôve developed to demonstrate real-world applications of data science.

Each project highlights a different aspect of the data analysis workflow ‚Äî from statistical computation to visualization to predictive modeling.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me
I‚Äôm passionate about **data-driven problem solving**. My expertise lies in:
- **Python programming** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **SQL debugging and optimization**  
- **Data visualization and storytelling**  
- **Reproducible research and modular workflows**  

This portfolio reflects my ability to not only write code, but also to **interpret results, communicate insights, and generalize solutions**.

## üöÄ How to Explore
1. Browse each project folder for:
   - **README.md** with project overview and insights  
   - **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step analysis  
   - **Python scripts** for reproducible workflows  
   - **Visual outputs** (plots, charts, tables)  

2. Run the projects locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-portfolio.git
   cd data-analysis-portfolio
   ```

## üìö Key Learnings
Through these projects, I‚Äôve strengthened my ability to:
- Clean and transform messy datasets  
- Apply statistical and machine learning techniques  
- Create compelling visualizations that tell a story  
- Write modular, reproducible, and well-documented code  

---

## üîÆ Next Steps
I‚Äôm extending this portfolio by:
- Applying the same techniques to **public datasets** (e.g., Stack Overflow, traffic, demographics)  
- Building **interactive dashboards** with Streamlit and Plotly  
- Comparing **SQL vs. Pandas workflows** for large-scale analysis
